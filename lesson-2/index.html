      Apollo 11 (July 16–24, 1969) was the American spaceflight that first
      landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot
      Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at
      20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's
      surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin
      joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours
      together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on
      Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth
      crewed mission of NASA's Apollo program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to
      a worldwide audience. He described the event as "one small step for a man,
      one giant leap for mankind."

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the
      Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with the Soviet Union. On October 4,
      1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite.
      This surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world. It
      demonstrated that the Soviet Union had the capability to deliver nuclear
      weapons over intercontinental distances, and challenged American claims of
      military, economic and technological superiority.

      On May 25, 1961, Kennedy addressed the United States Congress on "Urgent
      National Needs" and declared:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal,
      before this decade [1960s] is out, of landing a man on the Moon and
      returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period
      will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range
      exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to
      accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate
      lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel
      boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is
      superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for
      unmanned explorations—explorations which are particularly important for
      one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man
      who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not
      be one man going to the Moon—if we make this judgment affirmatively, it
      will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there."-
      Kennedy's speech to Congress
